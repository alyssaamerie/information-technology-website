<h3> History of the Internet and Telecommunications</h3>
<h3>Telecommunications </h3>
The transmission of data, voice and video over distances using Technology
<br>Developments- </br>
<ul>
             <li>1830s- Telegraph invention enabled long-distance communication</li>
			 <li>1876- Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone</li>
			 <li>20th Century- Raido, televison and satellites revoluntionized communication</li>
			 <li>Present- Mobile networks (4G,5G), fiber optics and VolP enhance global connectivity </li> 
</ul>			 
			  
<h3>Internet </h3>
A worldwide netwrok connecting computers, allowing for instant communication and data sharing
<br>Developments- </br>
<ul>
             <li>1960s- ARPANET, the first version of the internet, was developed by the U.S military </li>
             <li>1980s-1990s- The World Wide Web (WWW) was created by Tim Berners-Lee, leading to web browsers and email services</li>
			 <li>2000s-Present- High-speed broadband, cloud computing, and social media redefine digital communication </li>
</ul>
<hr>
<H2> Data, Information and Knowledge</H2> 
<h3>Data </h3>
<ul>
<li>Definition- Raw, unprocessed facts and figures</li>
<li>Characteristics- Unorganized, lacks its own meaning, qualitative (opinions) or quantitave (numbers and measurements)</li>
<li>Example- A list of numbers (70,50, 55) or random words (orange, apple) </li>
</ul>

<h3>Information</h3>
<ul>
<li>Definition- Processed data that has meaning and context</li>
<li>Characteristics- It should be valuable, relevant, confidential, timely and secure</li>
<li>Example- The numbers (70,50,55) being labeled as student scores in an English test, become information because they now have meaning</li>
</ul>

<h3>Knowledge</h3>
<ul>
<li>Definiton-Using information effectively fro decision making </li>
<li>Characteristics- Involves critical thinking, analyzing data quality, and ensuring informationis appropriate for decision-making </li>
<li>Example- The teachers sees that most students scored less than 80, so they need extra lessons </li>
</ul>
